IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION REPORT
Prepared by: Ayman Shaikh

1. INTRODUCTION
The Iris flower dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning, containing measurements of 150 flowers from three species. This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

2. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Data Preparation
- Loaded dataset from data.csv
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Examined feature distributions
- Encoded target labels

2.2 Feature Engineering
- Standardized features using StandardScaler
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets

2.3 Model Development
- Implemented KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn
- Determined optimal k=7 through error rate analysis
- Trained model on standardized features

3. RESULTS
The model achieved:
- Accuracy: 96.67%
- Precision: 0.97 (weighted avg)
- Recall: 0.97 (weighted avg)

Confusion matrix showed:
- Perfect classification for Iris-setosa
- 1 misclassification between versicolor and virginica

4. DISCUSSION
Key observations:
- Petal measurements were more discriminative than sepal
- Standardization improved accuracy by ~5%
- Error analysis revealed most mistakes occur near class boundaries

5. CONCLUSION
The KNN algorithm proved effective for this classification task, achieving high accuracy with minimal preprocessing. Future work could explore alternative distance metrics or feature combinations.
